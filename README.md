# Pokemon-HTML-Page
I created a simple page on HTML that gives a question and allows you to submit your Yes or No response.
By clicking Yes or No on the page, one of the files pokemon2 or pokemon3 (depending on what you chose)
will be opened.
This page demonstrates using buttons, simple CSS components such as font-family, importing an image,
or linking another HTML page that will be opened when a certain button is clicked.
